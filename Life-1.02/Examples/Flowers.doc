 NAME:                                                                 
     
 flowers: a program that lets you draw floral compositions

 This program is  based on the following book:                               
                                                                             
               THE ALGORITHMIC BEAUTY OF PLANTS                              
                                                                             
     by Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz and Aristid Lindenmayer                     
                (Springer Verlag,1990)                                       
                                                                             
 This book shows how the growth and shape of plants may be modeled using     
 rewrite systems called Lindenmayer Systems (L-systems for short), and     
 how these systems can be used to generate images.                           
                                                                             
 The kind of flowers that can be drawn with this program are obtained with a
 variant of one of the grammars of this book.


 USAGE

 To start this program, just type 
   > load("flowers") ?
   > main ?                                     
                  
 After a while, a panel of 5 buttons appears.

 1- Drawing Init
    Clicking on Drawing Init causes a panel to appear, containing the drawing
    parameters.
    X and Y are the coordinates of the starting point of the flower in the
      window (in pixels); They may also be set by clicking in the drawing pad
      when no drawing is being performed (see 4- Draw). The origin of the
      window is its upper left corner. The X axis is left-right, the Y axis is
      top-down. The Z axis goes inside the screen.
    ax, ay, az are the next starting angle values: they correspond to rotations
      of the initial turtle around the X,Y and Z axises (in degrees).
    Complexity is an integer between 2 and 8: The higher this number, the more
      complex the flower drawn. This numbers corresponds to the number of
      derivations in the rewrite system. Adding 1 to the complexity makes the
      flower about twice bigger. 
    Zoom: It may be necessary to adjust the zoom factor if the complexity is
      changed. 

 2- Palette
    Clicking on Palette makes a new panel appear, with a color palette and
    buttons describing the parts of the flower whose colors can be modified. 
    Once one of these parts has been chosen, clicking on a new color makes its
    color change immediately. 
    The colors of the different parts of a flower in the process of being
    drawn are always consistent with the colors shown in the palette.

 3- PostScript Output
    Clicking on PostScript Output lets the user save the current drawing in a
    PostScript file.

 4- Draw
    Clicking on draw makes the drawing pad appear, and a flower being drawn.
    Clicking in the drawing pad during the drawing makes it stop. 
    Clicking in the drawing pad when no drawing is being performed sets the
    starting point of the next flower to be drawn.

 5- Quit
    Causes the program to stop.   


 FILES 

 The flowers.lf file contains the definition of the user interface and the
 definition of the L-System used to draw the flowers.
                                                                             
 The other files are:                                                        
 - flo_utils.lf : contains a number of utilities.                            
 - flo_gram.lf  : contains the L-Systems translator and the predefined       
                  symbols definitions                                        
 - flo_xtools.lf: contains all the xToolkit: definition of button types,...  
 - flo_custom.lf: contains all the customizable stuff: look of the interface,
                  default values for the flowers.                            
                                                                             
                                                                             
 flowers.lf is the main file of the demo. All the other files are 
 automatically loaded if they are in the same directory.
