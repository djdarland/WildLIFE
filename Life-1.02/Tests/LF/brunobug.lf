% The Brunobug saga: a work in six fits
% Final fix: 15.2.94

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Fit the original (From Bruno, 3.2.94):

:: titi(arg => 1).
:: pb(action => Action).

foo(X,Y) -> @(X,Y).

% Was buggy: X = foo(foo(titi,Y:titi), pb(action => @(Y)))?
% Was buggy: X = foo(foo(_,Y:titi), pb(action => @(Y)))?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Fit the second:

foo_a(X) -> t(X).
:: titi_a(1).
:: s_a(_).

p_a(pair(foo_a(Y:titi_a), s_a(B:@(Y)))).

% Was buggy: p_a(X)?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Fit the third:

foo_b(X) -> t(X).
:: titi_b(1).
:: s_b(_).

% Was buggy: X=pair(foo_b(Y:titi_b), s_b(B:@(Y)))? 
% X=pair(foo_b(Y:titi_b), s_b(Y))?

b_1(pair(foo_b(Y:titi_b), s_b(B:@(Y)))).
b_2(pair(foo_b(Y:titi_b), s_b(Y))).

% Was buggy: b_1(X)?
% b_2(X)?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Fit the fourth:

foo_c(X,Y) -> @(X,Y).
:: titi_c(1).
:: p_c(_).

% Was buggy: X=foo_c(foo_c(A,Y:titi_c), p_c(B:@(Y)))? 
% X=foo_c(foo_c(A,Y:titi_c), p_c(Y))?

% Z=p_c(B:@(Y)), X=foo_c(A,Y:titi_c)?
% X=foo_c(A,Y:titi_c), Z=p_c(B:@(Y))?

% X=foo_c(p_c(@(Y)), foo_c(_,Y:titi_c))?
% X=foo_c(p_c(@(Y)), foo_c(_,@(Y:titi_c)))?
% X=foo_c(p_c(Y), foo_c(_,Y:titi_c))?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Fit the fifth:

foo_d(X,Y) -> @(X,Y).
:: titi_d(1).
:: p_d(@(_)).

% Was buggy: X = foo_d(foo_d(_,Y:titi_d), p_d(@(@(Y))))?
% Was buggy: X = foo_d(foo_d(_,Y:titi_d), p_d(@(Y)))?    
% X = foo_d(foo_d(_,Y:titi_d), p_d(Y))?

d_1(foo_d(foo_d(_,Y:titi_d), p_d(@(@(Y))))).
d_2(foo_d(foo_d(_,Y:titi_d), p_d(@(Y)))).
d_3(foo_d(foo_d(_,Y:titi_d), p_d(Y))).

% d_1(X)?
% d_2(X)?
% d_3(X)?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Fit the sixth:

foo_e(X,Y) -> @(X,Y).
:: titi_e(1).
:: p_e(2=>_). % This removes the bug!

% X=foo_e(foo_e(_,Y:titi_e), p_e(@(Y)))?
% X=foo_e(foo_e(_,Y:titi_e), p_e(Y))?

e_1(foo_e(foo_e(_,Y:titi_e), p_e(@(Y)))).
e_2(foo_e(foo_e(_,Y:titi_e), p_e(Y))).

% e_1(X)?
% e_2(X)?
