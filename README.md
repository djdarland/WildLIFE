# WildLIFE
Plans and Goals
* I want to eventually get to an easy install method.
* There are prerequisites.
  * Update Test Suite with my improvements. -- *Done*
  * Update documents directory - I have created pdf's. *Done*
  * Change local directory to just be in Life tree. -- *Done*
  * Now, I believe, to install:
    * ./mk.sh
    * everything should be usable where it is in the source tree.
    * (e.g. *life_local*)
    * to run test_suite ./ts.sh
    * The Test Suite gives slightly different results from 4.01
    * I did not overwrite 1.02 files in IN or LF directories.
    * I have not investigated yet.
  * Add separate Makefile to make x version - and create different executable
  * Eventually work on x version
