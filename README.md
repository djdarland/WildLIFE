# WildLIFE
Plans and Goals
* I want to eventually get to an easy install method.
* There are prerequisites.
  * Update Test Suite with my improvements. -- *Done*
  * Update documents directory - I have created pdf's. *Done*
  * Change local directory to just be in Life tree. -- *Done*
  * Realized local directory would not be found if
  wild_life executed elsewhere.
  * Added cp_local.sh
  * Now, I believe, to install:
    *See Life/INSTALL file
    * to run test_suite ./ts.sh
    * for original 1.02 suite use ./ts-1.02.sh
    * for with X Windows enabled ./ts-X.sh

  * X Windows seems to display OK
  * But not capturing evants.

  * X Windows now getting events.
  * In life_local_redo2/Examples queens.lf works - but not a good font
  * I was gust using a font I knew existed.
  * flowers works somewhat - but also get fatal errors at points.
  * in life_local_redo2/Demo life_demo responds to events - things
  * it calls are not there yet

  * Main problem I I had that caused not getting events was
  * using a .wild_life file to start applications.
  * I found that out by accident!!!
