I now have a couple computers I can experiment with.
I started with a fresh install of Ubuntu Linux 20.04

I found the following prerquisites.
I installed emacs (GUI) using Ubuntu Software.
I added "export EDITOR=emacs" to .profile
(you could use a different editor)
Must reboot to take effect.

create directories "bin" and "src" under home directory.
create directory "WildLIFE" under "src"

You will need to following if you do not already
have them.

sudo apt install make
sudo apt install gcc
sudo apt install libx11-dev
sudo apt install csh

Get WildLIFE from github

https://github.com/djdarland/WildLIFE

Under Code
Download ZIP (WildLIFE-master.zip)

Move to src/WildLIFE & extract

change directory to
~/src/WildLIFE/WildLIFE-master/Life/Source

run command
./cp_local.sh

run
./ee

choose 111 to compile

choose 116 to run test suite.

There are some opts that require more software,
but are not required for WildLIFE itself.

WildLIFE

3/8/2021
I noticed and corrected 2 warnings in parser.c and print.c
I added script file ./ee I like to use for most things.
It has menus.
(it has subscripts also).
I added historical files. (useful to understand how I made changes.)

PREVIOUSLY
Having got a new (much faster computer) I cloned my WildLIFE code.
1st time I had done that.
I had a few things I needed to do.
I am using Ubuntu 20.04
I had to istall the c shell (csh)
sudo apt install tcsh
I had to set default editor
in .profile I added
export EDITOR=emacs
there were some missing work directories
I added
--------------------
chmod u+x editdiffs.sh
if (! -d "ERR" ) then 
    mkdir ERR
endif
if (! -d "OUT" ) then 
    mkdir OUT
endif
if (! -d "ERRDIFF" ) then 
    mkdir ERRDIFF
endif
if (! -d "REFDIFF" ) then 
    mkdir REFDIFF
endif
------------------------
in 
check_edit_all
check_edit_all-1.02
check_edit_all-X
-------------------------
I had the wromg path for
prefix		= ~/life_local_redo
in Makefile.102

I forgot to run
cp_local.sh

I forgot How to run X Windows Demo.
Correct way is
in Wildlife/life_local_xxxx_redo2
wild_life_X
load("life_demo")?
demo?

X sometimes has "fatal" errors.
Mostly on exit if clicking upper right hand corner.
I may not pursue.
My interests are not in X and I have little knowledge of it.
-----------------------------------------------------
Plans and Goals
* There is an easy install method. [see Life/INSTALL] that is:
* tar -xzvf WildLIFE..[version]...tar.gz
*  THEN in Life/Source subdirectory
* 
*  do
*   ./mk.sh to make most current version
*   ./mk-1.02.sh  to make version more compatible with 1.02 Test Suite
*   ./mk-X.sh     to make version with X Windows support compiled in
*   
*    Also
*       ./cp_local.sh   to copy local directories for all versions.
*
* There are prerequisites.
    * to run test_suite ./ts.sh
    * for original 1.02 suite use ./ts-1.02.sh
    * for with X Windows enabled ./ts-X.sh
* X Windows now getting events.
* There are some problems with X-Windows.
  * Main thing is to make sure that you have the needed fonts.
  * I am not personally using X-Windows - I have done all I know how
  * In life_local_redo2/Examples queens.lf works - but not a good font
  * I was just using a font I knew existed.
  * flowers works somewhat - but also get fatal errors at points.
  * in life_local_redo2/Demo life_demo responds to events - things
  * it calls are not there yet

  * Main problem I I had that caused not getting events was
  * using a .wild_life file to start applications.
  * I found that out by accident!!!

  * Completed getting X Windows working
  * Also works with cygwin

  * Went back to test suites -- See Source/Port.txt
