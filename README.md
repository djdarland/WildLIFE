# WildLIFE
Plans and Goals
* I want to eventually get to an easy install method.
* There are prerequisites.
  * Update Test Suite with my improvements. -- *Done*
  * Update documents directory - I have created pdf's. *Done*
  * Change local directory to just be in Life tree. -- *Done*
  * Realized local directory would not be found if
  wild_life executed elsewhere.
  * Added cp_local.sh
  * Now, I believe, to install: (in Life/Source directory)
    * ./mk.sh
    * ./cp_local.sh
    * to run test_suite ./ts.sh
    * The Test Suite gives slightly different results from 4.01
    * I did not overwrite 1.02 files in IN or LF directories.
    * I have not investigated differeces yet.
    * Going to create version of test suite - using original 1.02 data.
    * It will still use my (revised) scripts.



* Plan to add separate Makefile to make x version
  - and create different executable
  * Eventually work on x version

I have been informed that DEC was bought by Compaq in 1998.

And that Compaq was bought by HP in 2002.

I tried to contact HP, but got no response.
