  o Accumulators Expander
  -----------------------

  Main File: accumulators.lf

  This program expands an extended version of Definite Clause
  Grammars. You will find more information about this in the manual.


  o Shell
  -------

  Main File: shell.lf

  This program is a top level for Life, written in Life, and based on
  parser also written in Life. There are two versions of this program
  here: one uses the files with the .lf suffix, the other uses the files
  with the .exp suffix. The latter is better if you intend to actually
  use the shell, since all grammar rules are already expanded. 
  To use it, type:
   > load_exp("shell")? shell ?

  The first one is better if you want to look at the code or modify it.


  o Debugger
  ----------

  Main File: debug.lf
 
  This program provides some debugging facilities. You will find more
  information about this in Debug.doc.


  o Profiler
  ----------

  Main File: profiler.lf

  This is a small profiling module for Life programs. You will find more
  information about it in the manual.

 
How to load a program
---------------------

Type " import(MainFile) ? ", where MainFile is the main file of the tool.
For example, the profiler is loaded and opened with the query:

	> import("profiler")?


Notes:
-----

The shell program is the only one to use the builtins defined
in the source file raw.c; if this source file is left out then
only the shell will stop working.  The file raw.c defines raw
(i.e., unbuffered) terminal I/O and is dependent on low-level
system calls.  It is the most non-portable part of the system.
