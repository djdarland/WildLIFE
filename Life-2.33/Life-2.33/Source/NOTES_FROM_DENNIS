Changed abort_life() in built_ins.c to exit instead of returning to top level.
See INSTALL in main directory.

Have this working in cygwin now.
My big problem I had - but which fortunately didn't take long to find
was when I used tar to get files from Linux port, Linux is case sensitive
but cygwin (windows) is not thus some files were overwritten.
I went back to Linux- got rid of a lot of files (usually ones in all CAPS
had been from OS/2 port. Also got rid off anything else no longer useful.
There are still the hard coded paths mentioned below.
Also cleaned up warnings in regexp subdirectory. For some
reason had to run make in that directory with cygwin but not Linux.
I have not done anything to make configure or to use distribution Makefile work.
Identical code works for Linux & cygwin - this surprised me!!!!!

There are some paths that you will need to change.
One in the Makefile
And three  in .setup_djd1
All contain "dennis"
I made those copies so as to preserve the originals.
As it was crashing I commented parts out to locate problems.
I think about all is back to original but haven't tested that.
Also I copied some things manually to /usr/local - but changed nothing there.
I was using ./t.sh to compile - as I added some include files I am not sure
Makefile represents all dependencies.
I think I should change the release to 2.00, but info.c has only commented out
changes - otherwise it is harder to compare Tests output.
The files in all CAPS are the old OS2 port.
I drastically changed the allocation of the gamma_table. The <| declarations
in bi1.lf were crashing & I tracked it down to that. It seemed the table was
used before allocated. It is just allocated now to a fixed size at the
beginning - I think it was intended to be dynamic.
new_pitch.lf is a port of a prolog program I wrote to play a card game I liked
in my youth,'
