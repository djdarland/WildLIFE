A note on how to install the fonts:
===================================

Normally, the fonts are found automatically and are part of the
Wild_life release; nothing needs to be done.

  If you get a warning message telling you that the fonts were not
found, you have to make sure that the fonts in the directory
+SETUPDIR+/Demo/Fonts are actually accessible by your Xserver and are in
the right format. To do this, copy this directory to a location
/this/is/the/new/path/Fonts, which is accessible by your Xserver, and
then issue the command 

xset +fp /this/is/the/new/path/Fonts

before invoking wild_life. When asked if the demo fonts should be used
anyhow, answer 'yes'.

That's all! Good luck and let us know if you have any problems.
