Basic Installation
==================
3/4/2017 (2.33) Dennis J. Darland
Fixed abend (memory corruption) that occurred if there was extra ','
in an argument list. (An error message had been given that a ',' was
missing.) I made the program exit, as there seemed no way to recover.
In Ubuntu All except 3 in Test Suite match.
cannonical   - because there is a comma missing - error message changed & exits
condpred     - because of 2.31 addition of touch - refernce file had been missing - test not performed before - I have not verified result
modulule_test3 - affected by this fix - don't know why.

I've mainly trimmed out exta unneeded files that had accumulated.
Also I made the check_edit script touch reference files.
Otherwise, if either file did not exist, it would say there was a match.
I discovered three new cases of mismatches. 
Two I discovered were correct for sure & I updated reference files - they were from tests I had added from the handbook.
The other still does not match - It is probably correct - but I am too busy to examine carefully.

To install
tar -xzvf Life-2.31.tar.gx
in a directory you wish to place it.
Do next if you have not since 2.23
cp life_local-2.23.tar.gz ~
cd
tar -xzvf life_local-2.23.tar.gz

Go to Source subdirectory within in Life-2.31/Life-2.31
cd Source
./ee
select 111 to compile (assumes there is a ~/bin directory).
Other options are available on menu, e.g. 116 to run test suite.

I've mainly been modifying documentation for using dxoygen.
To install
tar -xzvf Life-2.30.06.tar.gx
in a directory you wish to place it.
Do next if you have not since 2.23
cp life_local-2.23.tar.gz ~
cd
tar -xzvf life_local-2.23.tar.gz

Go to Source subdirectory
cd Source
./ee
select 111 to compile (assumes there is a ~/bin directory).

6/29/2016 (2.13) Dennis J. Darland. (Revised 7/14/2016  for 2.23) 
I have reverted to the original .set_up and related files.
I have restored x files to .setup.
I made 2 fixes in SuperLint example (\\ for \).
X is not currently compiled in - I wanted to tacle the rest first.
I went back to the life_local files in  Life-1.02.tar.gz file as I originally received it.
However my make file is only set up to gernerate the executable wild_life
and it copies it to ~/bin.
I have set up the .set_up and other files to be in ~/life_local
I only edited them to change the paths to them within each other. (besides what I mentioned above)
I also edited the Makefile for wild_life to correspond.
I believe I have them all correct now.
This was done in 1.02 using the Makefile, sed, etc.
It would be good to make the Makefile do that, but that is more complicated.
The life_local files are found in life_local-2.23.tar.gz which should be copied to ~ and unpacked.
After unpacking the main archive (which you have done if you are reading this, run make in the Source/regep and then Source directories.
The Test Suite now runs perfectly in 64 bit Ubuntu.
The Test Suite has 3 cosmetic differences in 64 bit cygwin.
The wild_life has 2 compiler warnings in 32 bit ubuntu.
The Test Suite has 3 discrepancies in 32 bit ubuntu.
Within the script ./ee in the Source directory, you can do many things including running the Test Suite, and viewing the results etc.

Same procedure except is now Life-2.07.tar.gz
Also a new wild_life-mode.el is provided - it is useful mostly for indentation 
and syntax highlighting.

The local tar file is unchanged.

I do not know how to set up configure scripts - or have way of testing them.

As far as I know the following os all needed to set up WildLife 2.05
on either SUSE Linux, Ubuntu Linux or cygwin.

select a directory to install and copy Life-2.05.tar.gz there
then tar -xzvf Life-2.05.tar.gz
then copy local_life-2.05.tar.gz to ~
this will create a "local" directory there - if you already have a "local" directory there you may need to make some adjustment
then tar -xzvf local_life-2.02.tar.gz

Then go to directory you untarred Life-2.05 to
Then go to Source subdirectory
Then go to regexp subdirectory
use the command 'make'
cd ..
use the command 'make' again

-----------------------------------------------------------------

I found the tests are run with the quiet -q option so wl is no longer
provided wild_life has the current VERSION in the Makefile and the DATE
it is compiled is used. 

Then wild_life can be executed in the Source Directory; The Makefile
also copies it to ~/bin.
