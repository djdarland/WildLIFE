USE NOTE :
==========

The user interface of SuperLint is based on two shell scripts:
sl and slc.  Upon installing Wild_LIFE 1.0, edit these scripts
to contain the correct pathnames for the wild_life executable.

To compile rules type the Unix shell command:

    % slc rules_file
or 
    % slc -o my_analyzer rules_file

In the first case the analyzer will be put in a file called
superlint.lf in the current directory.  An example rules
file, rules.lf, is included, as well as an example analyzer
created by slc, superlint.lf.

To achieve verifications on C files, you have to type :

    % sl file1.c file2.c ...
or
    % sl -f my_analyzer file1.c file2.c ...

If the -f option is not given, there must be a file superlint.lf
in the current directory.

You can type :

    % sl -h
or
    % slc -h

to remember the syntax of these commands.
