LF - life program tested (-1.02 for originals)
IN - input read by life program (-1.02 for originals)
OUT - output of life program
ERR - error output of program

REFOUT - output expected (suffix _UPDATED for 4. PLUS)
REFERR - error expected (suffix _UPDATED for 4. PLUS)

Mainly I added more test from handbook in LF, IN, & _UPDATED directories.

There is a capability to approve output.
Very original REFOUT-1.02 and REFERR-1.02 not changed.

FILES contains files used by some programs.
