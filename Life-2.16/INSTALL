Basic Installation
==================
6/29/2016 (2.13) Dennis J. Darland.
I have reverted to the original .set_up and related files.
I went back to the Life-1.02.tar.gz file as I originally received it.
However my make file is only set up to gernerate the executable wild_life
and it copies it to ~/bin.
I have set up the .set_up and other files to be in ~/life_local
I only edited them to change the paths to them within each other.
I also edited the Makefile for wild_life to correspond.
I believe I have them all correct now.
This was done in 1.02 using the Makefile, sed, etc.
It would be good to make the Makefile do that, but that is more complicated.
The life_local files are found in life_local-2.13.tar.gz which should be copied to ~ and unpacked.
After unpacking the main archive (which you have done if you are reading this, run make in the Source/regep and then Source directories.
There are still bugs.
Within the script ./ee in the Source directory, you can do many things including running the Test Suite, and viewing the results etc.

Same procedure except is now Life-2.07.tar.gz
Also a new wild_life-mode.el is provided - it is useful mostly for indentation 
and syntax highlighting.

The local tar file is unchanged.

I do not know how to set up configure scripts - or have way of testing them.

As far as I know the following os all needed to set up WildLife 2.05
on either SUSE Linux, Ubuntu Linux or cygwin.

select a directory to install and copy Life-2.05.tar.gz there
then tar -xzvf Life-2.05.tar.gz
then copy local_life-2.05.tar.gz to ~
this will create a "local" directory there - if you already have a "local" directory there you may need to make some adjustment
then tar -xzvf local_life-2.02.tar.gz

Then go to directory you untarred Life-2.05 to
Then go to Source subdirectory
Then go to regexp subdirectory
use the command 'make'
cd ..
use the command 'make' again

I found the tests are run with the quiet -q option so wl is no longer
provided wild_life has the current VERSION in the Makefile and the DATE
it is compiled is used. 

Then wild_life can be executed in the Source Directory; The Makefile
also copies it to ~/bin.
